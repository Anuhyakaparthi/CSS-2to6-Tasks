    <h3>Design of optimize reversible vedhic multiplier for high speed DSP application</h3>
    <body>
    <p>Design of this project we used 4*4 Urdhva Triyakbhyam multiplier.This is ancient Indian Vedhic mathematic which increases the speed of multiplier this project proposed a delay optimized multiplier design based on reversible logic gates.</p>

    <h3>Low power approximate ternary multiplier architecture for image processing applications</h3>
    <body>
    <p>Design fo this project present an energy efficient approximate terinary full adder with CNTFET technology which is used in the reduction stage in this implementation of 6*6 approximate ternary multiplier. The proposed ternary full adder design has better performance than most of existing desidn in terms of speed and power, which exhibits an improvement in power upto 40%.The proposed approximate 6*6 multiplier design has power savage up to 51.76%, Further to verify the effectiveness ofv the proposed multiplier, it is validated in image processing application.</p>
